## 🚀 Featured Project: Hospital No-Show Prediction (2025)

> **Goal**: Predict whether patients will show up for their hospital appointments, minimizing operational costs.

🔧 **Tech**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Pandas, Docker, Airflow-ready  
📈 **Highlights**:
- Cleaned and engineered messy real-world temporal + categorical data  
- Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Prioritized **high recall** to catch no-shows  
- Used **SHAP** for model explainability  
- Achieved ~94% recall with tuned thresholding  
- Fully modular — built to integrate with Flask UI and Airflow

📦 **Repo (Coming Soon)**: `PredictML-Production`
