# Hi, I'm Ronit Saxena

**AI/ML Engineer | Data Scientist @ [Pragyaa.ai](https://pragyaa.ai) | IIIT-B PGDip | Deep Learning | MLOps | Full-stack ML**

I'm currently building intelligent, production-grade ML pipelines at [Pragyaa.ai](https://pragyaa.ai) — solving real-world problems using data-driven insights and predictive modeling. My work blends classical machine learning, solid engineering practices, and scalable deployment. I'm also passionate about deep learning and continuously improving my craft.

## Featured Project: Hospital No-Show Prediction (2025) ⭐️

> **Goal**: Predict whether patients will show up for their hospital appointments, minimizing operational costs.

**Tech**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Pandas, Docker, Airflow-ready  
**Highlights**:
- Cleaned and engineered messy real-world temporal + categorical data  
- Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Prioritized **high recall** to catch no-shows  
- Used **SHAP** for model explainability  
- Achieved ~94% recall with tuned thresholding  
- Fully modular — built to integrate with Flask UI and Airflow

**Repo (In Progress)**: [PredictML-Production](https://github.com/ronit22203/PredictML-Production)
